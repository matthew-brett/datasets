Although there were 40 participants, I only found 38
points.  I thought I detected two markers at around x=495,
y=38, so I included both in the output CSV.  Looking at
the next plot in the paper (figure 2) seemed to confirm
there were three points with x (hop) values near 495.
Without assuming the marker was two points, on figure 1,
I would only have accounted for two of the three x~495
values.
