Measurements digitized from figure 1 "Triple-hop distance
predicting vertical jump height" - see `original`
directory for details.

Participants:

> Forty National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)
Division I-AA men's and women's soccer student-athletes,
ranging in age from 18 to 23 years, participated (20
women, 20 men; age =  20 ± 1.4 years, height  =  172.8
± 9.2 cm, mass  =  71.9 ± 8.9 kg)

Triple hop measurement (in centimeters):

> Participants stood on the designated testing leg, with
the great toe on the starting line. They performed
3 consecutive maximal hops forward on the same (dominant)
limb.

Vertical jump measurement (in centimeters):

> ... we instructed the participant to bend the hips and
knees, and then, without pausing, jump as high as possible
and contact the highest peg reachable on the Jump It
measurement standard.

Although there were 40 participants, I only found 38
points on figure 1 (see `original` directory).
